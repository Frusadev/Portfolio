# Frusadev's Portfolio

So this is my personal portfolio, So you probably don't want to deploy it as is.

At least you need to be a little original right? LOL

## About Me

So If you don't Know me yet, I'm **Daniel**, a software developer from **Togo** (You probably don't know where that is, but it's in West Africa, near Ghana and Benin). 

I'm a **Creative Developer & Entrepreneur** who loves building beautiful experiences.

## Customization Guide

Want to make this portfolio your own? Here's what you need to do:

### Replace Images
In the `public/` folder, you'll find:
- `logo.png` - Replace with your own logo
- `daniel.png` - Replace with your profile picture

> **Pro tip:** If you want to change the filenames, just update the references in the code!

### Update Content
1. Edit `src/app/page.tsx` to change personal information
2. Update the skills array with your own technologies
3. Modify social media links to point to your profiles
4. Change the email address in the contact section

### Styling
- Global styles are in `src/app/globals.css`
- The project uses **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui
- Dark/light mode support is built-in via the theme provider, but i prefer the site to be in dark mode. Who the hell uses light mode anyway?
